# Modules Libraries

This folder contains libraries used to build modules. There are two types of modules within Tikal, the **universe** modules and the **nixos** modules. Each type has its own sub-directory. Finally, files used by both types reside in the **shared** directory.

## Universe Modules

The universe module defines all the entities (nahuales) that exist in a Tikal universe. For each nahual, a NixOs
module is eventually produced which contains the machine specific defintion for that Nahual. Inivetably, there
will be data that is to be shared among all Nahuales. For example, if two Nahuales are to be accessible via
ssh, they would need to know the public key of the other. Therefore, the universe module is meant to be used
to generate everything that is to be shared between Nahuales.

## NixOs Modules

These modules are standard NixOs modules that can be imported from standard NixOs configurations. The main
difference is that during the generation of the module, they have access to a context shared among all
Nahuales in the universe. This context was generated by the Universe modules. The files in the **nixos** directory
provide utilites to access and process this shared context.
